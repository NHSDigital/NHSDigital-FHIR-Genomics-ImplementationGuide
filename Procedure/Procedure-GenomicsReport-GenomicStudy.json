Please note that the sensitivity of this test is limited by the types of detectable pathogenic variants, regions of low read depth coverage and incomplete ascertainment of disease-gene associations.  Further information including read depth coverage is available on request. *Variants are classified using the ACMG/AMP guidelines (Richards et al 2015 PMID25741868)."
